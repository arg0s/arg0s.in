On the last day of our trip to Brussels, I and my colleagues visiting from the States made a trip down to the nearby town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghent">Ghent </a>where a large festival called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentse_Feesten">Gentse Feesten </a>was organized for their national day. There were several live music concerts happening at the same time - reggae, latin, rock and beer festivals along the way. Ghent is a pretty city with a medieval past, and retains the old world charm with little canals, old forts, and churches with spires. In particular, the tall belfry and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravensteen">Gravensteen </a>castle were noteworthy.<br /><br /><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8c/Ghent3.JPG"><img style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 2px;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8c/Ghent3.JPG/250px-Ghent3.JPG" border="0" /></a><br /><br />After a few hours of walking around, we chanced upon a henna (mehendi) tattoo parlor off the sidewalk. Quite promptly, we all decided to get tattoos. Jeff & Jeff got some lovely macho tattoos of a lizard and a bull, while Susan got a pretty little ornamental one on her back.<br /><br /><img style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 2px;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/320/DSC00195%20%28Small%29.jpg" border="0" /><br /><br />I was a wimp and simply got one on my palm, and so I was the Indian beggar walking around on the street with an open palm until the mehendi dried an hour later. I scribbled a little design of my own which the artist rendered beautifully. On top are  two of my passions - tennis (racquet) and writing (yes, its just a pen), with a two button  mouse connecting me to work (<a href="http://www.supportsoft.com/img/common/logo.gif">my company logo</a>).<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/1024/hennatattoo%20%28Small%29.jpg"><img style="border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 2px;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/320/hennatattoo%20%28Small%29.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />It lasted a week before fading slowly away.
