Bullets struck Alexis' right eye, chin and jaw. She now is blind in that eye and had several surgeries before her release."<br /></blockquote>She has lost her right eye and is still recovering from the multiple surgeries she has had to go through.<span id="fullpost"><br /><br />It surprises me that we havent heard too much about her story in the news.<br /></span>
