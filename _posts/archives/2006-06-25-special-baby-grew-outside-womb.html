In a freak case, a baby girl in the UK has survived and been delivered by emergency Caesarean after growing in her mother's abdomen. Doctors at Lister Hospital in Stevenage only realised Millie-An Pittman was in the wrong place when her mother Lisa was admitted for a caesarian operation. To read the full article, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/beds/bucks/herts/4197194.stm">click here</a>.<br /><br />Interestingly, this has raised a lot of debate about the possiblity of male pregnancy since it is possible to conceive outside the womb with an artifically induced fertilized egg. And as you may expect, same-sex marriage supporters are all over it.<br /><br />The new born baby was aptly named "Millie-An", a play on the words "one in a million".
