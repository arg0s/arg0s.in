I made a brief trip on Jan 18th to Seoul, Korea along with our sales team in an effort to identify strategic partners for our growth in the region. This was quite a hectic trip since it was the week before the wedding, and Monami and I had so many things to wrap up. On top of that, I spent more time in the air flying to Korea than on the ground during the day long meetings. The temperature changes were pretty harsh as well - going from pleasant Bangalore winter to humid Singapore where I had layover to freezing Seoul, where the mercury hit zero. By the time I got back, Monami had already left to Nagpur and it took me a day to unwind. However, all in all, it was a productive trip and here are a few pictures with Royce and Chih-Che.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sendarvimail/KoreaTripJan2007/photo#5038059601419050226"><img style="WIDTH: 337px; HEIGHT: 447px" src="http://lh6.google.com/image/sendarvimail/RerIg8PUHPI/AAAAAAAAAEk/Ycf8hzjGADo/DSC00569.JPG?imgmax=512" /></a><br /><br />We enjoyed a lovely dinner at a restaurant near our hotel. <a href="http://foodanddrinkbangalore.blogspot.com/2007/03/dinner-in-seoul-korea.html">I've posted a brief review on my food blog - make sure you check it out</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sendarvimail/KoreaTripJan2007/photo#5038059962196303138"><img style="WIDTH: 337px" src="http://lh6.google.com/image/sendarvimail/RerI18PUHSI/AAAAAAAAAE8/9JBpOUJebnc/DSC00573.JPG?imgmax=512" /></a>
