<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://www.anaesthesic.be/delirium/about/img/1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://www.anaesthesic.be/delirium/about/img/1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Did you know that the <a href="http://www.deliriumcafe.be/">Delirium Café</a> in Brussels holds the Guiness Book world record for the most beers? It's located in a little alleyway 5 minutes away from the Grand Place in the city center.<br /><br />You pass the sign of a pink elephant (BTW, I suspect the sign refers to the euphemism for delirium, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_elephant">seeing pink elephants</a>") and follow the stairs down to the basement, where everyone is seated on tall stools around large wooden barrels.  The huge menu offers a list of over 2000 beers from various countries - and yes, Kingfisher was listed.<br /><br />If you'd like to try a local beer, be sure to sample the dark Delirium and the Duvel ('Devil') - but be forewarned, they live up to their names! I didnt see any pink elephants or devils, but sure needed caffeine the next morning!<br /><br />All across Brussels, you find little statues of Manneken Pis, a young boy pissing. Legend has it that the child saved the Grand Place by putting out a bomb by pissing on the fuse. What really amused us though was finding a statue of his female counterpart, known as Jeanneke Pis right by the Cafe!
