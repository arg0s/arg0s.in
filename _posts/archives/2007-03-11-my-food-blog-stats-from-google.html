Google Analytics offers interesting insights into the visitors to your blogs. For instance, I found that<br /><ul><li>Most visitors to <a href="http://foodanddrinkbangalore.blogspot.com/">my food blog</a> come in through google - While this may sound obvious, I personally had thought most visitors were my friends and family<br /></li><li>The most common search keyword was <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=food+review+bangalore">'food review bangalore'</a>. When I tried searching google using these keywords, I found that my blog shows up second in the listing.<br /></li><li>50% of the visitors are repeat visitors</li></ul>Here's a few things I'd love to see Google Analytics add:<br /><ul><li>ability to get email alerts based on certain criteria - for instance, over 1000 visitors in a day<br /></li><li>ability to embed most commonly searched keywords from Analytics directly into the blog as a side pane</li></ul><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sendarvimail/ArviSBlog/photo?authkey=4fOQdHVmReQ#5040723383339001378"><img src="http://lh3.google.com/image/sendarvimail/RfQ_NdLtJiI/AAAAAAAAAKc/w9WZpdI4Ra8/s800/foodblog-googleanalytics-stats.JPG" /></a>
