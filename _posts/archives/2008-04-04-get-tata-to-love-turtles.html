I think its a good idea for Mr. Tata to move the port to another location rather than endanger the turtles.</p>        <p>By living up to the Tatas' environmental legacy, Ratan won't just save the highly-endangered Olive Ridley Turtles, he will also end up making Tata a better company.</p>        <p>The only problem is that I can't bring about that change alone. I need help from lots of people, especially you.</p>        <p>Please do what I've done. Write directly to Ratan  <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/india/turtles/write-to-tata" target="_blank">by clicking here</a></p>        <p>Thanks a million,<br />   vipin.bhatia@<a href="mailto:vipin.bhatia@gmail.com" target="_blank"></a></p> </div>
