I’m falling pretty behind on my blog and am writing a few ‘predated’ posts. ;-)<br /><br />I was in Pune and Nasik in July, visiting family and friends. Here are a few pictures – I’ll need to fill in the rest when I get time.<br /><br /><a href='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/1024/DSC00144-a%20%28Small%29.jpg'><img border='0' style='border:1px solid #000000; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/320/DSC00144-a%20%28Small%29.jpg'></a><br /><br />My cousin Varun showing my mom his lovely drumset. He uses his room on the second floor to practice, although he has to cover the drums with a cloth dampener to ensure he doesn’t wake up the rest of the neighborhood.<br /><br /><a href='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/1024/DSC00146%20%28Small%29.jpg'><img border='0' style='border:1px solid #000000; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/320/DSC00146%20%28Small%29.jpg'></a><br /><br />Street scene in old Nasik. While I’m not an expert at this, the little gully, wall painting of Shivaji, and architecture of the building with its louvers appeared typical.<br /><br /><a href='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/1024/DSC00148-a%20%28Small%29.jpg'><img border='0' style='border:1px solid #000000; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/320/DSC00148-a%20%28Small%29.jpg'></a><br /><br />The Kala Rama temple, perhaps one of the most significant shrines in the city, is known for its idol made of dark rock.<br /><br /><a href='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/1024/DSC00150-a%20%28Small%29.jpg'><img border='0' style='border:1px solid #000000; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/320/DSC00150-a%20%28Small%29.jpg'></a><br /><br />Bees! Bees! Bees! All around the temples, there were several tiny bees near all the deities. I clicked a picture, but it may be hard to see the little ones. There’s a nice wikipedia article on identifying common bees and wasps.<br /><br /><a href='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/1024/DSC00152-a%20%28Small%29.jpg'><img border='0' style='border:1px solid #000000; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/320/DSC00152-a%20%28Small%29.jpg'></a><br /><br />More interesting than the Rama temple is the Sita Gupha, the caves where Sita is believed to have hid during the Ramayana. We climbed down into the caves through a narrow passage where we literally had to crawl through on all fours. One thing for sure, there’s definitely no way Ravana’s ten heads would have made it through it ;-)  Picture of my mom with her childhood friend Bala and siblings Arthi and Adwait in front of the cave. They were such wonderful hosts.<br /><br /><a href='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/1024/DSC00156%20%28Small%29.jpg'><img border='0' style='border:1px solid #000000; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/320/DSC00156%20%28Small%29.jpg'></a><br /><br />The massive Kumbh mela which happens once every twelve years happens here.<br /><br /><a href='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/1024/DSC00163%20%28Small%29.jpg'><img border='0' style='border:1px solid #000000; margin:2px' src='http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/183/9786/320/DSC00163%20%28Small%29.jpg'></a><br /><br />Beautiful Nasik is wine country. Several rolling hills and miles and miles of wineyards. Here’s some pictures of the table grapes from Bala’s farm.
