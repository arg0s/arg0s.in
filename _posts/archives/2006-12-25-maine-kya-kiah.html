Melanie organized a fun carol singing event at work last week. Although I joined the first days practice, a bad throat infection kept me out through the rest of the week and although they amicably invited me to the final performance, all I could do was be the echo on '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer">Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer</a>'.<br /><br />"<span style="font-style: italic;">Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (Echo: Reindeer)</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Had a very shiny nose</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">And if you ever saw it</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">You would even say it glows (Echo: Like a lightbulb!)</span>"<br /><br />With Nihar on the guitar, and Babu on the drums, we had a fun ensemble together. We also sang a fun variant of the <a href="http://aravind-krishnaswamy.blogspot.com/2006/12/12-indian-days-of-christmas.html">12 Indian days of Christmas</a>.<br /><br />Monami got a holidays gift set of yum Ghirardelli chocolates.<br /><br /><a title="Santa" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/80672111@N00/332972685/in/photostream/"><img alt="Santa" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/161/332972685_6224affce1.jpg?v=0" border="0" height="400" width="300" /></a><br /><br />And oh, last Sunday, we went by <a href="http://www.kiahdiamonds.com/">Kiah's jewelery store outlet</a> and picked rings for each other. I chose a band (No, not really LOTR inspired). She chose a 'knot' with 44 little diamonds.
