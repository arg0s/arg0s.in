The book is dedicated to a young girl whom Kalam met and asked as "what is your dream" for which the young girl replied "I want to live in a developed India".<br /><br />Kalam, whose term as president ended this July has announced that he is going to teach at PSG College of Technology as a visiting professor. As you may have guessed by now, PSG Tech is my alma mater where I got my B.S. from, and I was quite thrilled to hear this since I'm sure Kalam will be a hit with students.<br /><br />To me at least, Kalam has been our greatest president ever, and a strong source of inspiration.<br /><br /><span style=";font-family:Arial;color:black;"  ><small><strong>Kalam to teach at PSG</strong></small></span><br />  <span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128);font-family:Verdana;font-size:78%;"  >Sunday August 26 2007 14:14 IST</span>            <small><span style="font-family:Verdana;"><br />COIMBATORE: Former President A P J Abdul Kalam has agreed to teach at PSG Institutions as a visiting professor.<br /><br />“I will take three to four classes this year, for about 60 students each.<br /><br />The subjects that I will concentrate on are mostly nano-science, nano-technology and also the influence of society in knowledge areas,’’ he announced here on Saturday.<br /></span></small><br /><small><span style="font-family:Verdana;">He wanted the undergraduate, post-graduate and the Ph.D students of PSG to take up the study of the implementation of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA) as a business proposition in the different areas around Coimbatore and added that there was already one Sakthi PURA in Pollachi.<br /><br />Only education and women’s empowerment would help the ranking of the country in the Global Competitiveness Report wherein India figured at the 43rd position.<br />(<a href="http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IE920070826015037">Full article here</a>)<br /></span></small>
