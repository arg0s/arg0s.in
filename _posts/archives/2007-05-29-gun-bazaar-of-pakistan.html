The tribe believes in 'many sons and lots of guns'. Over a thousand guns are made by hand every day in crude machine shops, and these are then supplied to Taliban terrorists through their network of cells.<br /><br />Thanks <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/view/user/17735179783175304347/state/com.google/broadcast">Bob</a> for sharing this video.
