I've resisted blogging about Bangalore and stray dogs (over 10 on my street!) - there's just enough said <a href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/stories/20070406002610200.htm">out there</a> and <a href="http://bangalore.metblogs.com/archives/2007/03/dogs_of_war.phtml">more</a>. But when I saw not one, but a dozen grazing cows from the balcony of my apartment, this really cracked me up. :-)  And in case you are wondering, I dont live in the  outskirts - we are 5 km from downtown MG Road, and nearby the Diamond District building where my company's office is.<br /><br />In the pictures below, you can see the cows grazing in the middle of open area (erstwhile military land, although practically abandoned today). You can see Diamond District and Natasha Golfview in the background. The strange fenced structure the cows are strutting around used to be a water tank.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yv40plZwgmI/RhlPR4GK5_I/AAAAAAAAAOE/VJ_p0rKGTQw/s1600-h/DSC01092+%28Large%29.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yv40plZwgmI/RhlPR4GK5_I/AAAAAAAAAOE/VJ_p0rKGTQw/s400/DSC01092+%28Large%29.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5051155625607358450" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yv40plZwgmI/RhlPR4GK6AI/AAAAAAAAAOM/v_tqko3E-uM/s1600-h/DSC01094+%28Large%29.JPG"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yv40plZwgmI/RhlPR4GK6AI/AAAAAAAAAOM/v_tqko3E-uM/s400/DSC01094+%28Large%29.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5051155625607358466" border="0" /></a>
