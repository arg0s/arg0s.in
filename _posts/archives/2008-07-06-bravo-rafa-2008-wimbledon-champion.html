Bravo Rafa!!!  Roger could not have lost to a better player, and the significant improvements in Rafa's game showed.  Roger staged a tremendous comeback with an attacking game that penetrated Rafa's defenses to event the score, but it was too late. Rafa prevailed <b>6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (8-10), 9-7. </b>This by far is <a href="http://aravind-krishnaswamy.blogspot.com/2007/07/whats-your-most-memorable-sporting.html">my favorite sporting moment ever</a>!!!!!  Like Alan mentioned to Vijay during the 'On the spot' roundup, today's game needed medical clearance for viewers - there were so many heart stopping moments. Rafa has taken men's tennis to a whole new level, and this will lead Roger and Nole to improvise only further. I cant help but feel fortunate to have watched this exceptional match live - what a great time for tennis.</div>
