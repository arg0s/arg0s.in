When I went into the theater to watch Casino Royale this weekend, I was expecting the usual 'leave your brains in the car park' - guns, babes and gizmos oversimplistic sensational masala mix.  Well, it had all of that, but all in all, was a credible and realistic movie.<br /><br />In fact, it may be the best Bond movie I've seen. Daniel Craig's character reminded me a lot of Alec Leamas, the protagonist from John le Carr√©'s novel 'The Spy who came in from the cold'.  It's difficult to pinpoint what it is - His hardened looks? Moral complexities?<br /><br />Or maybe simply the fact that unlike the other Bonds who would come out of a martial arts tussle dodging howitzers without any signs of a loose thread on their exquisite tailored suits, Daniel's character bleeds like the rest of us mortals.<br /><br />He's real.
