RIME<span style="font-style: italic;"><br />Pronunciation</span>: 'rIm<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Function:</span> noun<br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Etymology:</span> Middle English rim, from Old English hrIm; akin to Old Norse hrIm frost<br />1 : FROST 1b<br />2 : an accumulation of granular ice tufts on the windward sides of exposed objects that is formed from supercooled fog or cloud and built out directly against the wind<br /><br /><img src="http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/classes/met130/notes/chapter8/graphics/rime.jpg" valign="left" height="186" width="300" /><br /><br />According to Wikipedia, "<span style="font-style: italic;">Rime ice is a white ice that forms when the water droplets in fog freeze to the outer surfaces of objects. It is often seen on trees atop mountains and ridges in winter, when low-hanging clouds cause freezing fog. This fog freezes to the windward (wind-facing) side of tree branches, buildings, and any other solid object.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;">Rime ice is similar in appearance </span><span style="font-style: italic;">hoar frost</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> but whereas rime ice is formed by vapour first condensing to liquid droplets (of fog, mist or cloud) and then attaching to surface, hoar frost is formed by direct deposition from water vapour to solid ice.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /><br />Rime ice and glaze ice are also the two types of ice that can form on the surfaces of an aircraft, if it flies though a cloud made of supercooled water liquid droplets.</span> <p style="font-style: italic;">Rime ice is formed also inside of freezers, and on objects taken out of freezers on humid days, hoar frost is formed on their surfaces in a while."<br /></p>Having spent two long winters in cold Ames, Iowa in the late 90s, I'm quite familiar with this ice formation, but ironically learnt the word for it only today over a game of scrabble.
