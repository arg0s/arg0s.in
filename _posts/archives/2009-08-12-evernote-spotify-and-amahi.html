<p style="clear: both">I've been using <a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> for over a year now as my primary note taking app. It does a fantastic job keeping my notes in the cloud so I stay in sync between work, home and on my mobile. But it's "killer" feature is its handwriting recognition. Often enough, I end up taking notes on the go either in my notebook or on post-its. I just scan them and sync to Evernote, and its sophisticated script recognition searches the images. For business cards, Evernote just uses my Macbook's iSight camera to grab a snap. Now, I can check back at my notes anywhere anytime to find what I need - even from a cybercafe through their web interface.</p><p style="clear: both">Over the last week, I've taken the power of Evernote and applied it to a pretty mundane task - eliminating the clutter in my study (<a href="http://aravind-krishnaswamy.blogspot.com/2009/07/je-reve-un-reve.html" target="_blank">#7 on my 'list'</a>). I've taken every flyer, receipt, statement, document and printout and sorted them into three categories:<br /><ol style="clear: both"><li>Trash. Heads straight for the bin. This category was about 20% of the junk that had piled up.</li><li>Soft storage. I scan a copy, upload to Evernote and trash the paper. This category was larger than I had imagined. 80% of the papers lying around were things I didnt need hard copies of. This made a huge difference in eliminating a lot of papers.</li><li>Permanent storage. I scanned the copy, uploaded to Evernote, and categorized the documents into manila folders for archival in a closet.</li></ol></p><p style="clear: both">I've used a dozen different note taking tools in the past - from OneNote to Treepad, but I dont think any of them come close to Evernote. I would highly recommend giving it a try!</p><p style="clear: both">While on the topic of useful software, here's two others to check out:<br /><ul style="clear: both"><li><a href="http://www.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify</a> - Forget Last.fm and Pandora. Get onto Spotify for listening to music. You'll need to use an online proxy to work around the country restrictions and use it in India.</li><li><a href="http://www.amahi.com" target="_blank">Amahi</a> - Take an old laptop/desktop and convert it into a media center that streams your home collection of movies, music, and files. Plus, access it from anywhere using the inbuilt VPN (based on Open VPN). Currently runs on Fedora.</li></ul></p><br class='final-break' style='clear: both' />
