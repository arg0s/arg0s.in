Amazingly enough, many of the best things in life come simple and easy.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">O</span> Discovering the <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-earth-easter-egg-flight.html">Flight Simulator in Google Earth</a> - this is probably <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-earth-easter-egg-flight.html">the best Easter egg</a> ever. It may not be the best simulator game, but its pretty amazing considering the data is real. Try flying off Kathmandu over the Himalayas as well as from San Francisco across the Bay on a high speed line where rendering will be smooth. Also check out planetary models in Sky mode.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">O</span> Watching <a href="http://www.kalyansuman.com/2007/05/movie-review-beja-fry.html">Bheja Fry</a> on a tiring long haul flight left me with a smile on my face, and a fuzzy feeling left by movie magic. <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://im.rediff.com/movies/2007/apr/13bheja1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 160px;" src="http://im.rediff.com/movies/2007/apr/13bheja1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Vinay Pathak (see pic) steals the show in this simple and delightful film (remake of a French movie).<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">O</span> Forget Hollywood and Bollywood. YouTube video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU8DDYz68kM">Battle at Kruger National Park</a> - kidnappings, in-fighting, tug-o-war, action stunts, vengeance, and a happy ending for a young buffalo - the Animal Kingdom has it all.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">O</span> A bag of rice can save the day. Or at least <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/20/how-to-clean-up-water-damaged-electronics-the-rice-bowl/">help recover a wet mobile</a>, as I found out after I accidentally slipped (sigh - this is embarrassing!) into a river. After blowdrying, huffing and puffing, attempting to dismantle it, and then just praying, I found this <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/20/how-to-clean-up-water-damaged-electronics-the-rice-bowl/">grain of truth</a> (bad pun, I know).<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">O</span> Fun little multi-burst shots off my camera while Monami and I were at Gokarna for a quick weekend retreat. The trip cost us barely Rs. 2,500/- all in all including the bus, food and lodging, and was great value.<br /><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1236/1331171557_d0c022bfd4_m.jpg" /> <img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1197/1331172597_0dfed0deb9_m.jpg" />
