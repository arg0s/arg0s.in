I'm currently in Shanghai for work related meetings and have been having trouble getting to Blogspot since the Chinese government censors access to various internet sites.<br /><br />I've found a useful hack from a Chinese blogger:<a href="http://tenementpalm.blogspot.com/2007/03/sweet-blogspot-fix-from-chinese-blogger.html">sweet-blogspot-fix-from-chinese-blogger</a>. The Russian <a href="http://www.anonymizer.ru/">Anonymizer </a>site seems to work, but not for all sites.
