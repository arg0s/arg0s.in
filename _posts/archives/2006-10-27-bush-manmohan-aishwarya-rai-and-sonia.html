(I'm posting a joke a friend forwarded me - source unknown)<br /><br />Bush, Manmohan, Aishwarya rai and Sonia are traveling in a train. The train goes through a tunnel and it gets completely dark. Suddenly there is a kissing sound and then a slap! The train comes out of the tunnel. The women and Manmohan are sitting there looking perplexed. Bush is<br />bent over holding his face, which is red from an apparent slap. All of them remain diplomatic and nobody says anything.<br /><br />Sonia is thinking:<br />These Americans are all crazy after Aishwarya. Bush must have tried to kiss her in the tunnel. Very proper that she slapped him.<br /><br />Aishwarya is thinking:<br />Bush must have tried to kiss me but kissed Sonia instead and got slapped.<br /><br />Bush is thinking:<br />Damn it. Manmohan must have tried to kiss Aishwarya. She might have thought it was me and slapped me.<br /><br />Manmohan is thinking:<br />If this train goes through another tunnel I will make another kissing sound and then i'll again slap bush...
