It turns out that Manmohan Singh needs 33 cabinet ministers as a part of his panel.  In contrast, <a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/32/20090528/1054/tnl-obama-has-15-ministers-to-run-us-but.html">Obama requires only 15</a>.  That said, Manmohan has a significant challenge maintaining a balance across the social and regional dimensions of the coalition party. They have chosen to go with several young leaders, with a large number of ministers in their 40s and some in the 30s. Interestingly, there are four ministers from Karnataka.  Clearly, this is a sign for the BJP government in Bangalore.<div><br /></div><div>In other news, it turns out that the publishers of the Archie comics have decided that he finally needs to <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/22/graphic-books-best-seller-list-may-16/">choose between Veronica and Betty</a>. In some ways, it feels like a short sighted way of attracting some attention to the franchise.  But then, who knows how this might turn out. Let's play out a few possible endings depending on whom the script ends up with.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hollywood Producer: <i>Archie is about to propose to Veronica, but makes a last minute decision to propose to Betty. Veronica finds love with Jughead.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>Independent Producer: <i>Archie finds true love with Jughead. Betty proposes to Moose. Veronica drives into the sunset with Reggie.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>Bollwood Producer: <i>Copies the Hollywood script, adds Anu Malik music, but changes the storyline to a Karz style remix with Archie proposing to Veronica, getting murdered by her evil father's goons, being reborn and proposing to Betty's daughter.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>And oh, here's an interesting article that presents an <a href="http://agile.scumniotales.com/2009/02/why-incremental-development-is-better-an-roi-perspective.html">ROI model for using Agile vs. Traditional methods</a>. </div><div><br /></div>
