The four main things I had to do in order to get things working were:</div><div><br /><ul><li><b>Partition</b>: Split my 80GB partition to offer 1GB for Puppy, 256MB of swap space, and the rest for a shared FAT partition. Yes, you got that right - just 1GB. Puppy Linux is 100MB in size. I kept the rest of the partition FAT in case I decide to install Win7 in the future or share files with my Macs. With Puppy, you also have the option of booting off a USB dongle. Unfortunately, my R31 BIOS didn't support it and I had to install off a CD.</li><li><b>Kernel boot params</b>: On my IBM R31, I had to add i8042.nomux=1 in the kernel boot params to work around a Thinkpad mouse bug. Without this, the pointer ends up being all jumpy.</li><li><b>Wireless</b>: Unless you are lucky enough to have a card or dongle on <a href="http://www.puppylinux.org/wiki/hardware/general/wirelessworking">this list</a>, you'll need to scrounge around with the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/ndiswrapper/index.php?title=Main_Page">ndiswrapper</a> layer. It took me a while, but I finally have a strong signal from my Airport Extreme.</li><li><b>Apps</b>: The pup may be a little lite for your preferences plain vanilla. I added on Firefox, Transmission, OpenVPN, Java and Skype.  Grab a precompiled Skype binary from <a href="http://www.puppylinux.org/community/blogs/7of9sdad/installing-skype-puppy-linux-412">here</a>.</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>Also look at: <a href="http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/">DSL</a>, <a href="http://www.amahi.org/">Amahi</a>.</div><div><br /></div></div></div>
