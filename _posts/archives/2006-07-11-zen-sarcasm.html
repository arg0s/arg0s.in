1. Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I may not follow. Do not walk beside me either.  Just pretty much leave me the hell alone.<br />    2. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt and leaky tire.<br />    3. It's always darkest before dawn. So if you're going to steal your neighbor's newspaper, that's the time to do it.<br />    4. Don't be irreplaceable. If you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted.<br />    5. Always remember that you're unique. Just like everyone else.<br />    6. Never test the depth of the water with both feet.<br />    7. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments.<br />    8. Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes.  That way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you havetheir shoes.<br />    9. If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.<br />    10. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach him how to fish, and he will sit in a boat and drink beer all day.<br />    11. If you lend someone $20 and never see that person again, it was probably worth it.<br />    12. If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.<br />    13 Some days you're the bug; some days you're the windshield.<br />    14. Everyone seems normal until you get to know them.<br />    15. The quickest way to double your money is to fold it in half and Put it back in your pocket.<br />    16. A closed mouth gathers no foot.<br />    17. Duct tape is like 'The Force'. It has a light side and a 'Dark Side', and it holds the universe together.<br />    18. There are two theories to arguing with women. Neither one works.<br />    19. Generally speaking, you aren't learning much when your lips are moving.<br />    20. Experience is something you don't get until just after you need It.<br />    21. Never miss a good chance to shut up.<br />    22. Never, under any circumstances, take a sleeping pill and a laxative<br />    on the same night.
