He spent much of his life helping the Sherpas, and was also the Ambassador to India for a short stint. I saved a 5 dollar note from my 2005 New Zealand trip as a little souvenir with his profile.<br /></div><br />“<span style="color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">I think it all comes down to motivation. If you really want to do something, you will work hard for it.</span>” - Sir Edmund Hillary<br /><br /></div>
