And, who did they think would ever buy it for $499.95? ;-)<br /><br />And in case you were wondering what the hell the long winded title means, fractal image compression was a novel technique back in the late 80s/early 90s that competed with JPEG. (And yes, complex project titles helped garner brownie points with the profs).<br /><br />Our project focused on applying the IFS techniques to video images. The compression ratios were very high (1:100 and higher), but the speed of compression and quality were poor. We experimented with parallelizing our algorithm on PARAM and the IBM SP2 32-node cluster, which yielded some performance improvements.<br /><br />If you've been around in the industry long enough, you might recall JPEG gained popularity partly due a faster decompression technique, but also due to the political power of the joint photographers group.<br /><br />So, would we have made it big had JPEG not won out? Probably not, but it was an interesting project. And oh, I still have my project report with me. Not for sale however, thank you.<br /><br /><a title="93CS Report" href="http://static.flickr.com/136/332970775_92599ea4ac.jpg?v=0"><img alt="93CS Report Cover" src="http://static.flickr.com/136/332970775_92599ea4ac.jpg?v=0" border="0" height="300" width="400" /></a><br /><br /><a title="93CS Report" href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/161/332970815_3db5b80e4d.jpg?v=0"><img alt="Report Results Summary Table" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/161/332970815_3db5b80e4d.jpg?v=0" border="0" height="300" width="400" /></a><br /><br /></div>
