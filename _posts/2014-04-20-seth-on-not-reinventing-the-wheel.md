> Steal your business model. We don't have a shortage of business models, it's okay if you pick one that's already working for someone else.
> When it comes down to the thing you will be known for, your uniqueness, your gift, your thing worth talking about--don't steal that.
> For the rest, honor those that came before and use their work as a building block for yours.
