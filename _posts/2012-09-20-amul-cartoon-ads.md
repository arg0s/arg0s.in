This is my dedication to Dr Kurien of Amul, who passed away recently (September 9th 2012) at the age of 90. The Amul topical ads have been around since the 70s and have a deep connect with every Indian. I built this app on a whim since the Amul site didnt offer an easy to browse through the cartoons. Enjoy the new and updated [Amul Cartoon Ads](http://itunes.apple.com/in/app/amul-cartoon-ads/id363119867) app for the iPhone & iPad (2x mode). If you'd like to contribute to the project, the source code is on [Github](http://arg0s.in/amulios/). Fork away and send in a pull request.
