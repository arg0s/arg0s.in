It was just a matter of time. My [old blog](http://aravind-krishnaswamy.blogspot.com/) from blogspot was lying virtually abandoned.

I'd considered *Posterous*. And *Tumblr*. But somehow, the instant gratification of getting a quick tweet or Facebook wall post out in between the zillion other things going on the middle of my day seemed to keep winning out.

Until now. I've switched over to a new *Markdown* flavored blog which promises to be easier to maintain and update. So maybe, just maybe, I'll start to pen down my thoughts now and then just a little more.

As for the old archives, I've tried moving them over. Some of it made the hop just fine, but a lot of posts either got scrambled or had dead ends with image links or media. I might get to cleaning some of that at some point, but more likely not.
