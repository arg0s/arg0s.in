I'd blogged recently about how we've adopted a [new approach](http://arg0s.in/running-efficient-meetings-at-your-startup.html) to how we're running meetings at Levitum.

If you'd like to know more about how why we'd scheduled our meetings this way, I'd encourage you to read the [original post](http://arg0s.in/running-efficient-meetings-at-your-startup.html).

## Open Knowledge Sharing - The Knot

We've begun to host the `Knot` on Thursday mornings at 9AM IST \| 8:30PM PDT. One of the things that has always amazed me about the [Levitum](http://www.levitum.com) team is the amount of *talent and knowledge* everyone has on a wide range of subjects. Often enough, the day to day routine of our work doesn't let us explore this as much as we'd like. And what better way to bring a team together than just share your knowledge and passion with each other.

> **And what better way to bring a team together than just share your knowledge and passion with each other.**

We're hoping to cover off a wide range of topics - technology, business, social media, sports, photography, music and more. The goal of these sessions is to keep things *informal*, and not need a lot of prep. The topics are also *not* related directly to our business or products.

The first Knot this morning was hosted by [Vishnu](http://twitter.com/vishnuratheesh), who did an amazing job of priming us on photography. In a little over a half hour, he provided an introduction to the key concepts behind `aperture`, `shutter speed`, and `ISO`. He also covered `depth of field`, `framing`/`composition`, and a number of simple tips that apply to camera phones as well. I'm inspired enough to go out and pick up a `DSLR`!

In the interest of sharing this with everyone else who are interested, we plan open this out to the public. So, if you don't mind ad-hoc learning without a set agenda or formal structure, join us on our *weekly* Knot Hangout on-air. Or, just come hang out and say hello!

**Knots happen every Thursday, at 9AM IST \| 8:30PM PDT**. We'll post updates on upcoming Knots on our [Google Plus page](https://plus.google.com/u/1/103997295567093285121/posts) and on our [Twitter handle](http://twitter.com/levitum).

### Guest Speakers - The Friendship Knot

One of the things we'd love to do once we've started to get a little bit of structure (read: less screw ups) around how we're running the on air sessions is invite friends at other startups to join us for guest sessions. We're open to most topic ideas - we'd just like to keep it informative, informal and useful. We think this might be a nice way to brings birds of a feather together, and find others who share common hobbies and passions. If you'd like to be a guest speaker write to [hello@levitum.com](mailto:hello@levitum.com) or ping [@twitortat](http://twitter.com/twitortat).
