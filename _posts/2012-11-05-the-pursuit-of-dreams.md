The Education section of todays Times of India has covered my wife [Monami Bhattacharya](http://www.projectemm.com), chronicling her journey from an REC Warangal engineering grad working in the IT industry to breaking away to set up Project Emm and establishing herself as an artist with her [Studio+Gallery](http://www.projectemm.com).

I hope this inspires others to walk the path they really believe in, and strive to make a difference! Impossible is nothing.
