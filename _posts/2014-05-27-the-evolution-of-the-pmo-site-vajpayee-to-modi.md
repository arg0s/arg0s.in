**Note**: The PMO [website policy](http://pmindia.nic.in/website_policy.php){:target="_blank"} section indicates that external sites must get their permission before linking in to it. I've sent in a request for permission, but I hope this policy is just a relic of the old website that never did get updated. In case you are from NIC or PMO and would like the link removed, please [contact me](http://arg0s.in/ask-me-anything/).
