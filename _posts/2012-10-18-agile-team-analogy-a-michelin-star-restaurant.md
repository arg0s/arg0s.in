My favorite analogy of great team work has always been the Beatles. A group of diverse people coming together to build off each others strengths, and improvising when someone is down.

However when I recently had to put together a slide to explain to executives at a partner firm how an agile software development team works best, I drew up the analogy of how the kitchen at a Michelin star restaurant works. Analogies arent always perfect, and maybe it's all the time I've spent lately watching Masterchef Australia, but this just felt right (see slide above).
